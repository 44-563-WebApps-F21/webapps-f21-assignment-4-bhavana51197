    <h4>FIRST ACT ACT I. _The Octagon Room in Sir Robert Chiltern’s House in Grosvenor
        Square_.</h4>
    <pre>[_The room is brilliantly lighted and full of guests_.  _At the top of
the staircase stands_ LADY CHILTERN, _a woman of grave Greek beauty_,
_about twenty-seven years of age_.  _She receives the guests as they come
up_.  _Over the well of the staircase hangs a great chandelier with wax
lights_, _which illumine a large eighteenth-century French
tapestry—representing the Triumph of Love_, _from a design by
Boucher—that is stretched on the staircase wall_.  _On the right is the
entrance to the music-room_.  _The sound of a string quartette is faintly
heard_.  _The entrance on the left leads to other reception-rooms_.  MRS.
MARCHMONT _and_ LADY BASILDON, _two very pretty women_, _are seated
together on a Louis Seize sofa_.  _They are types of exquisite
fragility_.  _Their affectation of manner has a delicate charm_.
_Watteau would have loved to paint them_.]</pre>
                

        <p>MRS. MARCHMONT.  Going on to the Hartlocks’ to-night, Margaret?</p>

        <p>LADY BASILDON.  I suppose so.  Are you?</p>
        
        <p>MRS. MARCHMONT.  Yes.  Horribly tedious parties they give, don’t they?</p>
        
        <p>LADY BASILDON.  Horribly tedious!  Never know why I go.  Never know why I
            go anywhere.</p>
        
        <p>MRS. MARCHMONT.  I come here to be educated.</p>
        
        <p>LADY BASILDON.  Ah! I hate being educated!</p>
        
        <p>MRS. MARCHMONT.  So do I.  It puts one almost on a level with the
            commercial classes, doesn’t it?  But dear Gertrude Chiltern is always
            telling me that I should have some serious purpose in life.  So I come
            here to try to find one.</p>
        
        <p>LADY BASILDON.  [_Looking round through her lorgnette_.]  I don’t see
            anybody here to-night whom one could possibly call a serious purpose.
            The man who took me in to dinner talked to me about his wife the whole
            time.</p>
        
        <p>MRS. MARCHMONT.  How very trivial of him!</p>
