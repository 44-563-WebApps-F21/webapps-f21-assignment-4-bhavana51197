    <h5 class="stagedirection">[_The room is brilliantly lighted and full of guests_. _At the top of
        the staircase stands_ LADY CHILTERN, _a woman of grave Greek beauty_,
        _about twenty-seven years of age_. _She receives the guests as they come
        up_. _Over the well of the staircase hangs a great chandelier with wax
        lights_, _which illumine a large eighteenth-century French
        tapestry—representing the Triumph of Love_, _from a design by
        Boucher—that is stretched on the staircase wall_. _On the right is the
        entrance to the music-room_. _The sound of a string quartette is faintly
        heard_. _The entrance on the left leads to other reception-rooms_. MRS.
        MARCHMONT _and_ LADY BASILDON, _two very pretty women_, _are seated
        together on a Louis Seize sofa_. _They are types of exquisite
        fragility_. _Their affectation of manner has a delicate charm_.
        _Watteau would have loved to paint them_.]</h5>

    <p class="speech">
    <h4 class="MARCHMONT">MRS. MARCHMONT.</h4> Going on to the Hartlocks’ to-night, Margaret?</p>

    <p class="speech">
    <h4 class="BASILDON">LADY BASILDON.</h4> I suppose so. Are you?</p>

    <p class="speech">
    <h4 class="MARCHMONT">MRS. MARCHMONT.</h4> Yes. Horribly tedious parties they give, don’t they?</p>

    <p class="speech">
    <h4 class="BASILDON">LADY BASILDON.</h4> Horribly tedious! Never know why I go. Never know why I
    go anywhere.</p>

    <p class="speech">
    <h4 class="MARCHMONT">MRS. MARCHMONT.</h4> I come here to be educated.</p>

    <p class="speech">
    <h4 class="BASILDON">LADY BASILDON.</h4> Ah! I hate being educated!</p>

    <p class="speech">
    <h4 class="MARCHMONT">MRS. MARCHMONT.</h4> So do I. It puts one almost on a level with the
    commercial classes, doesn’t it? But dear Gertrude Chiltern is always
    telling me that I should have some serious purpose in life. So I come
    here to try to find one.</p>

    <p class="speech">
    <h4 class="BASILDON">LADY BASILDON.</h4>
    <p class="stagedirection" :hover> [_Looking round through her lorgnette_.]</p> I don’t see
    anybody here to-night whom one could possibly call a serious purpose.
    The man who took me in to dinner talked to me about his wife the whole
    time.</p>

    <p class="speech">
    <h4 class="MARCHMONT">MRS. MARCHMONT.</h4> How very trivial of him!</p>

    <p class="speech">
    <h4 class="BASILDON">LADY BASILDON.</h4> Terribly trivial! What did your man talk about?</p>

    <p class="speech">
    <h4 class="MARCHMONT">MRS. MARCHMONT.</h4> About myself.</p>

    <p class="speech">
    <h4 class="BASILDON">LADY BASILDON.</h4>
    <p class="stagedirection" :hover>[_Languidly_.]</p> And were you interested?</p>

    <p class="speech">
    <h4 class="MARCHMONT">MRS. MARCHMONT.</h4>
    <p class="stagedirection" :hover> [_Shaking her head_.]</p> Not in the smallest degree.</p>

    <p class="BASILDON">
    <h4 class="name">LADY BASILDON.</h4> What martyrs we are, dear Margaret!</p>

    <p class="speech">
    <h4 class="MARCHMONT">MRS. MARCHMONT.</h4>
    <p class="stagedirection" :hover> [_Rising_.]</p> And how well it becomes us, Olivia!</p>

    <p class="stagedirection" :hover>[_They rise and go towards the music-room_. _The_ VICOMTE DE NANJAC, _a
        young attaché known for his neckties and his Anglomania_, _approaches
        with a low bow_, _and enters into conversation_.]</p>

    <p class="speech">
    <h4 class="MASON">MASON.</h4>
    <p class="stagedirection" :hover> [_Announcing guests from the top of the staircase_.]</p> Mr. and
    Lady Jane Barford. Lord Caversham.</p>

    <p class="stagedirection" :hover>[_Enter_ LORD CAVERSHAM, _an old gentleman of seventy_, _wearing the
        riband and star of the Garter_. _A fine Whig type_. _Rather like a
        portrait by Lawrence_.]</p>

    <p class="speech">
    <h4 class="CAVERSHAM">LORD CAVERSHAM.</h4> Good evening, Lady Chiltern! Has my good-for-nothing
    young son been here?</p>

    <p class="speech">
    <h4 class="LADYCHILTERN">LADY CHILTERN.</h4>
    <p class="stagedirection" :hover> [_Smiling_.]</p> I don’t think Lord Goring has arrived yet.</p>

    <p class="speech">
    <h4 class="MABELCHILTERN">MABEL CHILTERN.</h4>
    <p class="stagedirection" :hover> [_Coming up to_ LORD CAVERSHAM.]</p> Why do you call Lord
    Goring good-for-nothing?</p>

    <p class="stagedirection" :hover>[MABEL CHILTERN _is a perfect example of the English type of prettiness_,
        _the apple-blossom type_. _She has all the fragrance and freedom of a
        flower_. _There is ripple after ripple of sunlight in her hair_, _and
        the little mouth_, _with its parted lips_, _is expectant_, _like the
        mouth of a child_. _She has the fascinating tyranny of youth_, _and the
        astonishing courage of innocence_. _To sane people she is not
        reminiscent of any work of art_. _But she is really like a Tanagra
        statuette_, _and would be rather annoyed if she were told so_.]</p>
