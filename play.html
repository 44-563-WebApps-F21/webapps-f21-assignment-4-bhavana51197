    <h3>FIRST ACT ACT I. _The Octagon Room in Sir Robert Chiltern’s House in Grosvenor
        Square_.</h3>
    <p><h5>[_The room is brilliantly lighted and full of guests_.  _At the top of
        the staircase stands_ LADY CHILTERN, _a woman of grave Greek beauty_,
        _about twenty-seven years of age_.  _She receives the guests as they come
        up_.  _Over the well of the staircase hangs a great chandelier with wax
        lights_, _which illumine a large eighteenth-century French
        tapestry—representing the Triumph of Love_, _from a design by
        Boucher—that is stretched on the staircase wall_.  _On the right is the
        entrance to the music-room_.  _The sound of a string quartette is faintly
        heard_.  _The entrance on the left leads to other reception-rooms_.  MRS.
        MARCHMONT _and_ LADY BASILDON, _two very pretty women_, _are seated
        together on a Louis Seize sofa_.  _They are types of exquisite
        fragility_.  _Their affectation of manner has a delicate charm_.
        _Watteau would have loved to paint them_.]</h5></p>
                

        <p><h4>MRS. MARCHMONT.</h4>  Going on to the Hartlocks’ to-night, Margaret?</p>

        <p><h4>LADY BASILDON.</h4>  I suppose so.  Are you?</p>
        
        <p><h4>MRS. MARCHMONT.</h4>  Yes.  Horribly tedious parties they give, don’t they?</p>
        
        <p><h4>LADY BASILDON.</h4>  Horribly tedious!  Never know why I go.  Never know why I
            go anywhere.</p>
        
        <p><h4>MRS. MARCHMONT.</h4>  I come here to be educated.</p>
        
        <p><h4>LADY BASILDON.</h4>  Ah! I hate being educated!</p>
        
        <p><h4>MRS. MARCHMONT.</h4>  So do I.  It puts one almost on a level with the
            commercial classes, doesn’t it?  But dear Gertrude Chiltern is always
            telling me that I should have some serious purpose in life.  So I come
            here to try to find one.</p>
        
        <p><h4>LADY BASILDON.</h4><p>  [_Looking round through her lorgnette_.]</p>  I don’t see
            anybody here to-night whom one could possibly call a serious purpose.
            The man who took me in to dinner talked to me about his wife the whole
            time.</p>
        
        <p><h4>MRS. MARCHMONT.</h4>  How very trivial of him!</p>

        <p><h4>LADY BASILDON.</h4>  Terribly trivial!  What did your man talk about?</p>

        <p><h4>MRS. MARCHMONT.</h4>  About myself.</p>

        <p><h4>LADY BASILDON.</h4><p>[_Languidly_.]</p>    And were you interested?</p>

<p><h4>MRS. MARCHMONT.</h4><p>  [_Shaking her head_.]</p>  Not in the smallest degree.</p>

<p><h4>LADY BASILDON.</h4>  What martyrs we are, dear Margaret!</p>

<p><h4>MRS. MARCHMONT.</h4><p>  [_Rising_.]</p>  And how well it becomes us, Olivia!</p>

<p>[_They rise and go towards the music-room_.  _The_ VICOMTE DE NANJAC, _a
    young attaché known for his neckties and his Anglomania_, _approaches
    with a low bow_, _and enters into conversation_.]</p>

<p><h4>MASON.</h4><p>  [_Announcing guests from the top of the staircase_.]</p>  Mr. and
Lady Jane Barford.  Lord Caversham.</p>

<p>[_Enter_ LORD CAVERSHAM, _an old gentleman of seventy_, _wearing the
    riband and star of the Garter_.  _A fine Whig type_.  _Rather like a
    portrait by Lawrence_.]</p>

<p><h4>LORD CAVERSHAM.</h4>  Good evening, Lady Chiltern!  Has my good-for-nothing
    young son been here?</p>

<p><h4>LADY CHILTERN.</h4><p>  [_Smiling_.]</p>  I don’t think Lord Goring has arrived yet.</p>

<p><h4>MABEL CHILTERN.</h4><p>  [_Coming up to_ LORD CAVERSHAM.]</p>  Why do you call Lord
Goring good-for-nothing?</p>

<p>[MABEL CHILTERN _is a perfect example of the English type of prettiness_,
    _the apple-blossom type_.  _She has all the fragrance and freedom of a
    flower_.  _There is ripple after ripple of sunlight in her hair_, _and
    the little mouth_, _with its parted lips_, _is expectant_, _like the
    mouth of a child_.  _She has the fascinating tyranny of youth_, _and the
    astonishing courage of innocence_.  _To sane people she is not
    reminiscent of any work of art_.  _But she is really like a Tanagra
    statuette_, _and would be rather annoyed if she were told so_.]</p>
