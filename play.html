         <h4>FIRST ACT ACT I.  _The Octagon Room in Sir Robert Chiltern’s House in Grosvenor
            Square_.</h4>
            <pre>_The room is brilliantly lighted and full of guests_.  _At the top of
                the staircase stands_ LADY CHILTERN, _a woman of grave Greek beauty_,
                _about twenty-seven years of age_.  _She receives the guests as they come
                up_.  _Over the well of the staircase hangs a great chandelier with wax
                lights_, _which illumine a large eighteenth-century French
                tapestry—representing the Triumph of Love_, _from a design by
                Boucher—that is stretched on the staircase wall_.  _On the right is the
                entrance to the music-room_.  _The sound of a string quartette is faintly
                heard_.  _The entrance on the left leads to other reception-rooms_.  MRS.
                MARCHMONT _and_ LADY BASILDON, _two very pretty women_, _are seated
                together on a Louis Seize sofa_.  _They are types of exquisite
                fragility_.  _Their affectation of manner has a delicate charm_.
                _Watteau would have loved to paint them_.
                MRS. MARCHMONT.  Going on to the Hartlocks’ to-night, Margaret?

                    LADY BASILDON.  I suppose so.  Are you?
                    
                    MRS. MARCHMONT.  Yes.  Horribly tedious parties they give, don’t they?
                    
                    LADY BASILDON.  Horribly tedious!  Never know why I go.  Never know why I
                    go anywhere.
                    
                    MRS. MARCHMONT.  I come here to be educated.
                    
                    LADY BASILDON.  Ah! I hate being educated!
                    
                    MRS. MARCHMONT.  So do I.  It puts one almost on a level with the
                    commercial classes, doesn’t it?  But dear Gertrude Chiltern is always
                    telling me that I should have some serious purpose in life.  So I come
                    here to try to find one.
                    
                    LADY BASILDON.  [_Looking round through her lorgnette_.]  I don’t see
                    anybody here to-night whom one could possibly call a serious purpose.
                    The man who took me in to dinner talked to me about his wife the whole
                    time.
                    
                    MRS. MARCHMONT.  How very trivial of him!
